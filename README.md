# Creating_PDFs
This repository contains code from a short tutorial that I did on how to use Node.js to create pdfs.


In order to run this site, do the following in your code editor (e.g. Visual Code Studio):

Download the zip file and upload it to your editor, or open your editor's terminal and run git clone https://github.com/Catalinaeva1/Creating_PDFs.git.

If you run the git clone command, navigate/change directory into the file folder.

1. Make sure that you have the latest Node.js installed.
2. Open 2 terminals in bash/node (make sure you aren't in Powershell).
3. In the first terminal, cd (change directory) to client (e.g. cd client).
4. In the second terminal, cd (change directory) to server (e.g. cd server).
5. In the second terminal, run the command nodemon index.js.
6. In the first terminal, run the command, npm start.

Your browser should open up to localhost:3000 and display the page.
